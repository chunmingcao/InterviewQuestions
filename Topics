## The difference between InputStream and InputStreamReader when reading multi-byte characters  
An InputStream reads raw octet (8 bit) data.
An InputStreamReader then will transform data from some encoding into UTF-16.
The character encoding API in Java contains the algorithms to perform this transformation.
